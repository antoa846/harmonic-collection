      <h3>Memory and Nostalgia</h3>
     <div id="harvest-moon"> 
      <p class="song">Harvest Moon by Neil Young</p>
      <p>Sarah</p>
      <p>“I think it is the most iconic because I have known it since I was young and my dad plays it on guitar for me. Plus the way he uses so many instruments in the song is sooo good. It's about growing in love with someone and how that is rare (like a harvest moon) but it's beautiful when it happens even if only for a little bit of time and it can happen again.”</p>
      <p class="song">The Two of Us by The Beatles (Cover by Aimee Mann)</p>
     </div>
      <p>Sarah</p>
      <p>“I grew up listening to it and also the lyrics are literally about doing silly things with someone just for the sake of doing them together which I think is such a good portrayal of love. Her voice to me sounds like the first snow falling and being excited to see it and drinking tea and autumn rain.”</p>
      <p class="song">Something About Us by Daft Punk</p>
      <p>Mahani</p>
      <p>“Star crossed lovers, LITERALLY! This romantic tune with a sci-fi backdrop acts as both noble goodbye and (final) confession. I grew up on Daft Punk, this may as well have been my first love song.”</p>
      <p class="song">As Long As You Love Me by Isak Danielson</p>
      <p>Cecilia</p>
      <p>“One of my good friends did her senior [dance] solo to it and it was beautiful. I think it's about romantic love but it reminds me of my dance friends and how hard it was to leave them when I went to school. It connects to the song and is so meaningful because even though I don’t see my old dance friends everyday I still love them and I hope they never forget how much I love them and vice versa.”</p>
      <p class="song">Golden Brown by The Strangers</p>
      <p>Hayley</p>
      <p>“because it reminds me of like a slower love that you yearn for I have no idea how to explain that but it's also about heroin and a girl according to the singer and how both make him feel good so uh”</p>
      <p class="song">En Nuit by VideoClub</p>
      <p>Aiden</p>
      <p>“En Nuit is a French song that feels so nostalgic, and is about overcoming existential boredom while finding solace in the company of someone you love.”</p>
