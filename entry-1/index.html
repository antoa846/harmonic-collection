        <p class="song">Harvest Moon by Neil Young</p>
        <p>Sarah</p>
        <p>“I think it is the most iconic because I have known it since I was young and my dad plays it on guitar for
          me. Plus the way he uses so many instruments in the song is sooo good. It's about growing in love with someone
          and how that is rare (like a harvest moon) but it's beautiful when it happens even if only for a little bit of
          time and it can happen again.”</p>

      <div id="something-about-us">
        <p class="song">Something About Us by Daft Punk</p>
        <p>Mahani</p>
        <p>“Star crossed lovers, LITERALLY! This romantic tune with a sci-fi backdrop acts as both noble goodbye and
          (final) confession. I grew up on Daft Punk, this may as well have been my first love song.”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="en-nuit">
        <p class="song">En Nuit by VideoClub</p>
        <p>Aiden</p>
        <p>“En Nuit is a French song that feels so nostalgic, and is about overcoming existential boredom while finding
          solace in the company of someone you love.”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="they-long-to-be-close-to-you">
        <p class="song">(They Long to Be) Close to you by The Carpenters</p>
        <p>Ellis</p>
        <p>“This song is meaningful to me because when I was born this song was playing in the hospital and ever since, my parents have sung it to me. Reminds me of childhood and their love for me”</p>
