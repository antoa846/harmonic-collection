        <p>Evie</p>
        <p>“On the Floor by Perfume Genius is about how a crush or being in love can take over one's mind, in beautiful
          and dark tortured ways. The production really feels like that experience, the ups, the downs, the internal
          fight.”</p>

        <p>“I picked this song because of how it perfectly conveys what it's like to have an overwhelming admiration for
          another person, and how no one else can ever compare to them.”</p>
