        <p class="song">Nothing by Bruno Major</p>
        <p>Natalie</p>
        <p>“This one I like bc it focuses on little things about loving someone and does a good job at simplifying the parts that are often dramatized/over played in media but also kinda brings out that being in love with someone isn't always grand gestures”</p>

        <p>Hayley</p>
        <p>“because it reminds me of like a slower love that you yearn for I have no idea how to explain that but it's
          also about heroin and a girl according to the singer and how both make him feel good so uh”</p>
