        <p>“I like this one bc it focuses more on like being there for a friend going through it  and I feel like it means a lot to me and it's a good reminder to be there for when your friends need it and let them know your door is always open when they're not ready to talk”</p>

        <p class="song">As Long As You Love Me by Isak Danielson</p>
        <p>Cecilia</p>
        <p>“One of my good friends did her senior [dance] solo to it and it was beautiful. I think it's about romantic
          love but it reminds me of my dance friends and how hard it was to leave them when I went to school. It
          connects to the song and is so meaningful because even though I don't see my old dance friends everyday I
          still love them and I hope they never forget how much I love them and vice versa.”</p>
