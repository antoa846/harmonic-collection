        <p>Sarah</p>
        <p>“I grew up listening to it and also the lyrics are literally about doing silly things with someone just for
          the sake of doing them together which I think is such a good portrayal of love. Her voice to me sounds like
          the first snow falling and being excited to see it and drinking tea and autumn rain.”</p>

        <p>Polly</p>
        <p>“This song has such a fun energy to it, it always gets people dancing. It gives you the feeling you get when you start to really like someone and you just want them to with you so bad. iIt has a fun banter to it as well.”</p>

        <p>Brenna</p>
        <p>“It's one of the few songs I've ever heard that really captures the banter that comes with love, but also the fact that it can be interpreted as platonic or romantic, or both!”</p>
